    <h1>KiCad Pin Extraction Plugin with GUI</h1>

    <p>This plugin is designed to help you extract detailed pin and property information from components (footprints) on your KiCad PCB into user-friendly Markdown and CSV formats. It provides robust filtering, flexible sorting, and customizable output options.</p>

    <h2>Features:</h2>

    <h3>1. Dynamic Selection & Details</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The plugin dialog opens immediately when launched, even if no components are initially selected on the PCB.</li>
        <li>You can <strong>select/deselect components directly in the KiCad PCB editor</strong> while this dialog is open.</li>
        <li>Use the "<strong>Refresh Selection from PCB</strong>" button within the dialog to update the list of components displayed in the dialog's "Selected Components" panel based on your current PCB selection.</li>
        <li>Click on any component's reference designator in the "Selected Components" list to view its detailed properties (Reference, Value, Footprint Name, Description, Layer, Position, Rotation, and custom properties like 'connector-type') in the "Selected Component Details" panel for quick review.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-select from PCB</strong>: If this checkbox is enabled, clicking "Refresh Selection from PCB" will *add* newly selected components from the PCB to the existing list in the dialog, rather than replacing the entire list. This allows you to build a cumulative selection.</li>
        <li><strong>Remove Selected from List</strong>: This button allows you to remove one or more items that you have selected within the dialog's "Selected Components" list. Use standard click, Ctrl+click, or Shift+click to select multiple items in the list before clicking this button.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Flexible Export Options (Buttons)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Export Selected</strong>: Exports data for <em>only</em> the components currently displayed in the "Selected Components" list (i.e., those that were selected on the PCB and refreshed into the dialog). This button is automatically enabled/disabled based on whether components are in the "Selected Components" list.</li>
        <li><strong>Export 'J's</strong>: Exports data for <em>all</em> components on the entire PCB whose Reference Designator starts with the letter 'J' (e.g., J1, J2, JUMP1, J_CONN).</li>
        <li><strong>Export Connectors (by Type)</strong>: Exports data for <em>all</em> components on the entire PCB that have a custom property named "<code>connector-type</code>" whose value matches any of the comma-separated types you define in the "Connector Type Filter" field (e.g., "harness,backplane").</li>
        <li><strong>Extract Unique Connector Nets</strong>: Generates a CSV file containing a list of all unique net names connected to the pins of the currently displayed components (if any are in the list) or all components with a 'connector-type' property on the board. This is useful for creating net lists for specific connector types.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Advanced Filtering Options (Text Inputs with Auto-Suggest)</h3>
    <p class="note">These filters apply to the "Export 'J's", "Export Connectors (by Type)", and "Extract Unique Connector Nets" options. The filter fields now provide auto-suggestions populated from data currently present on your board.</p>

    <h4>Value Filter:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Filter components based on their 'Value' field.</li>
        <li><strong>How it Works</strong>: Enter a partial or full string. Only components whose 'Value' field (e.g., <code>10k</code>, <code>0.1uF</code>, <code>LED</code>) contains this text (case-insensitive) will be included. The field provides auto-suggestions of existing values on your board.</li>
        <li><strong>Auto-Suggest Content:</strong> All unique component values found on your current PCB (e.g., "<code>10k</code>", "<code>0.1uF</code>", "<code>ATMEGA328P</code>", "<code>CONN_1x03</code>").</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong>
        <p>If you type <code>100n</code>, it might include capacitors with value <code>100nF</code>.</p>
        <p>If you type <code>CONN</code>, it might include generic connectors with value <code>CONN_1x02</code>.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Net Name Filter (any pin):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Filter components based on their connected net names.</li>
        <li><strong>How it Works</strong>: Enter a partial or full string. Only components that have <em>any</em> pin connected to a net whose name contains this text (case-insensitive) will be included. The field provides auto-suggestions of existing net names on your board.</li>
        <li><strong>Auto-Suggest Content:</strong> All unique net names found on your current PCB (e.g., "<code>VCC</code>", "<code>GND</code>", "<code>SCL</code>", "<code>Net-(R1-Pad1)</code>", "<code>/USB_DP</code>").</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong>
        <p>If you type <code>VCC</code>, it might include all components connected to <code>VCC</code>, <code>VCC_3V3</code>, etc.</p>
        <p>If you type <code>SCL</code>, it might include components on your I2C clock line.</p>
        <p>If you type <code>Net-(J1-Pin1)</code>, it will filter for components connected to that specific auto-generated net name.</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Connector Type Filter (comma-sep):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Filter components based on their custom "<code>connector-type</code>" property. This filter is primarily used by the "<strong>Export Connectors (by Type)</strong>" button.</li>
        <li><strong>How it Works</strong>: Enter one or more values, separated by commas (e.g., <code>harness,backplane</code>). Only components that have a custom property named "<code>connector-type</code>" whose value (case-insensitive) exactly matches <em>any</em> of the comma-separated entries you provide will be included. The field provides auto-suggestions of existing "connector-type" values found on your board.</li>
        <li><strong>Auto-Suggest Content:</strong> All unique values of the custom property "<code>connector-type</code>" found on your current PCB (e.g., "<code>harness</code>", "<code>backplane</code>", "<code>power_conn</code>", "<code>board2board</code>").</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="example-box">
        <strong>Example:</strong>
        <p>If a component has a custom property <code>connector-type</code> with value <code>harness</code>, and you type <code>harness</code> into the filter, it will be included.</p>
        <p>If you type <code>power,board2board</code>, it will include components with <code>connector-type: power</code> OR <code>connector-type: board2board</code>.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>4. Output Customization Checkboxes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Sort Components by Reference (A-Z)</strong>: If checked, the exported Markdown and CSV tables will list components alphabetically by their reference designator (e.g., C1, C2, J1, U1). If unchecked, they will appear in the order they were processed (typically discovery order).</li>
        <li><strong>Highlight Same Nets in Markdown Output</strong>: If checked, net names in the Markdown output's "Pin Details" tables will be color-coded. Pads connected to the same net will have their net name displayed in a unique, automatically assigned color. This visual distinction requires a Markdown viewer that supports inline HTML styling (e.g., VS Code, GitHub).</li>
        <li><strong>Ignore 'Unconnected' Pins (CSV)</strong>: If checked, any pins whose net name is literally "unconnected" (case-insensitive) will be excluded from the generated CSV file.</li>
        <li><strong>Ignore Free Pins (CSV)</strong>: If checked, any pins that have no net assigned to them (i.e., are truly unconnected or floating) will be excluded from the generated CSV file.</li>
        <li><strong>Include [Property Name]</strong>: A series of checkboxes allowing you to choose exactly which general properties (Reference, Value, Footprint Name, etc.) and pin details (Pad Name/Number, Net Name) are included as columns in the Markdown and CSV output files.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Progress Feedback</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A progress bar and status text will indicate the plugin's activity during lengthy export operations, providing visual feedback.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>For component/pin reports, each component starts with a "<code>Component: [Reference]</code>" header row.</li>
                <li>Below the header, the component's selected general properties are listed as key-value pairs (e.g., "Reference,J1", "Value,2x10 Header").</li>
                <li>Then, a header row "Connector Name,Pin Number,Net Name" is provided, followed by rows for each pin.</li>
                <li>Pins are filtered based on the "Ignore Unconnected Pins" and "Ignore Free Pins" checkboxes.</li>
                <li>For the "Extract Unique Connector Nets" output, it's a simple single-column CSV of unique net names.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future Enhancements (Suggestions):</h2>
    <p>Consider adding these features to make the plugin even more powerful:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Export to Excel (XLSX):</strong> Direct export to a structured Excel file, potentially with multiple sheets for different data views, which is often preferred for professional data analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Configuration Saving:</strong> Implement saving and loading of user preferences (e.g., checkbox states, filter values) between KiCad sessions.</li>
        <li><strong>Integration with Schematic Data:</strong> (Advanced) Directly access and include data from the schematic symbols (e.g., full datasheet links, manufacturer part numbers that aren't pushed to footprints) for a truly comprehensive report.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Property Selection:</strong> Allow the user to define and select *any* custom properties found on the board to be included as columns in the output.</li>
        <li><strong>Netlist Export:</strong> Option to export a simplified netlist for the selected components.</li>
        <li><strong>Board Outline Drawing (SVG):</strong> Re-implement the generation of a visual SVG diagram of the board outline with highlighted components, potentially as a standalone export or embedded in a report.</li>
    </ul>
